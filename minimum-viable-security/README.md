### Password Manager

A password manager can be used to protect against any attacks that may result from third-party database breaches. While it won’t directly protect against an attack on the platform where the database was compromised — as a hacker will have your login information for that specific service — it will mitigate the potential fallout and ensure that login will not give them access to your other sensitive accounts.+

With a password manager, a single password unlocks an application which manages the passwords for all of the services you use on the internet. When properly configured, the password manager should “autofill” your username and password when you go to log in to a service, such that you only need to press enter and \(ideally\) enter a two-factor authentication code — which I’ll explain further in just a moment.+

It is important to remember that if you can memorize your password, it’s not a good password. The password manager can also generate unique, hard-to-crack passwords for all of the services you use, the goal being that if a single service has their database compromised, only your password for that specific service is compromised.
